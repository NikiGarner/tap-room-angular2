#### To-Do List in Angular2, August 9, 2016

## Description

To-Do List in Angular
Follow along with the weekend Angular lessons to create the complete Angular To-Do List. Take your time and don't copy and paste.

If you don't complete this today today you may do so tomorrow. It is extremely important to complete this assignment before tackling other projects. There is quite a lot of material to work through, so as you and your partner read, stop every couple of paragraphs and try to summarize their meaning together, taking some notes. If you read a paragraph that didn't make sense to you be sure to write it down and take a guess its meaning. Usually, as you read, you'll be able to fill in the blanks or zero in on anything that you don't understand so that you can either Google it, ask a friend, or consult a teacher. This is partially an exercise in reading comprehension.

Be sure to complete the To-Do List lessons from the weekend before moving on. Then proceed to the following steps:

Read through tonight's homework lesson on Pipes, following along to learn how to sort your tasks, filtering them by whether or not they are complete.
Create a priority property on your Task model. When I create a Task, I want to assign it a priority of either "High", "Normal" or "Low". Be sure to print out the priority of a task with its other information in your task display.
Add a category property to your Task model, as you did with the priority property, displaying the new information. Allow your user to choose between three categories: "Work", "Hobby", "Home" tasks.

Be sure to complete the To-Do List lessons from the weekend before moving on. Then proceed to the following steps:

* Read through tonight's homework lesson on Pipes, following along to learn how to sort your tasks, filtering them by whether or not they are complete.
* Create a priority property on your Task model. When I create a Task, I want to assign it a priority of either "High", "Normal" or "Low". Be sure to print out the priority of a task with its other information in your task display.
* Add a category property to your Task model, as you did with the priority property, displaying the new information. Allow your user to choose between three categories: "Work", "Hobby", "Home" tasks.

Further Exploration

Cement your knowledge of pipes and expand the structure of your app by working on the following goals. Or, if you would rather practice the fundamental steps in building up an Angular app from scratch, move on to the Tap Room App.

* Add a second menu to filter by priority. As a user, I want to be able to see all of the "Not Done" tasks that are "High" priority. Practice your research skills to see how to pass multiple pieces of information into a pipe. Or, see if you can figure out how to use multiple pipes.
* When I create a Task, I should be assigning it to a category ("Work", "Hobby", or "Home") using a menu or radio buttons. We are currently hard-coding these categories. Now, see if you can figure out how to allow your user to create their own categories. For a bonus, allow your user to sort by categories too so that I can see all tasks that are "Not Done", "High" priority, and "Work" tasks.
* Add styling to your list based on each task's category and priority.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
